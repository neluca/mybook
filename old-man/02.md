They picked up the gear from the boat.

他们把用具从船上拾起来

The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft.

老人把船桅扛在肩上，男孩拿着木盒，里面装着盘绕的一卷卷编织牢实的棕色钩丝，鱼叉，鱼钩还有鱼钩的柄。

The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.

船尾是装着鱼饵的盒子，旁边是制服大鱼的木棒。

No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.

没有人会偷老人的东西，但是帆和钓丝还是拿回家的好，因为怕露水，而且，虽然他很确定本地人没有一个会偷他的东西，老人总觉得不必要把鱼钩和鱼叉丢在船上，引诱人家。

They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its open door. 

他们一起沿着路走上去，走到老人的小屋，屋子门开着，他们走了进去。
